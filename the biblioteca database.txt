1. Who checked out the book 'The Hobbitâ€™?

select member_id from checkout_item where book_id = (select id from book where title = "The Hobbit");



2. How many people have not checked out anything?

select count(*) from member where id not in (select member_id from checkout_item);


3. What books and movies aren't checked out?

select title from book where id not in (select distinct(book_id) from checkout_item);
select title from movie where id not in (select distinct(movie_id) from checkout_item);


4. Add the book 'The Pragmatic Programmer', and add yourself as a member. Check out 'The Pragmatic Programmer'. Use your query from question 1 to verify that you have checked it out. Also, provide the SQL used to update the database.

insert into book values (11, 'The Pragmatic Programmer');
insert into member values (43, 'Nirvana Boodhun');
insert into checkout_item values (43, 11,'');
select member_id from checkout_item where book_id = (select id from book where title = "The Pragmatic Programmer");


5. Who has checked out more than 1 item? 
Tip: Research the GROUP BY syntax.

select name 
from member 
where id in 
	(select member_id 
	from checkout_item 
	group by member_id 
	having count(member_id) = 
		(select max(mycount) 
		from (select member_id, count(member_id) mycount 
			from checkout_item 
			group by member_id)));
